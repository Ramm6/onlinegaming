         		<p>for some it is privileage</br>
         		for others it is right </br>
        		the difference between darkness </br>
       		 and a future that is bright </p>
        		<p>some will think a <b>burden</b></br>
        		 where others see a gift </br>
        		 the key to moving <i>forward</i></br>
       		 and to give your life a lift</p>
